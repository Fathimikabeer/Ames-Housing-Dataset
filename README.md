Task 1:- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
Task 2:-
    a) Create a robust machine learning algorithm to accurately predict the
price of the house given the various factors across the market.
    b) Determine the relationship between the house features and how the
price varies based on this.
Task3:- Come up with suggestions for the customer to buy the house according
to the area, price and other requirements.

Data Description
Worked on Ames Housing dataset to predict house prices using supervised machine learning techniques.Executed end-to-end data processing, including missing value imputation, categorical encoding,
feature selection, and scaling.Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.Implemented regression models and tuned hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
Evaluated model performance using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ², ensuring high accuracy and robustness.Visualized feature importance to understand key drivers of housing prices.
